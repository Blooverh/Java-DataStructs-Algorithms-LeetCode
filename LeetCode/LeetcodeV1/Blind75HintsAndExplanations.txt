LT1. TWO SUM
Question: 
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Example: 
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Algorithm:
Since return value is an int array that stores 2 indices, create result array 
Create hashmap that will store key as the value at index and value and the index (k,v) = (arr[i], i)
for loop to iterate O(n) i through the parameter array known as nums[] 
if a key with value target - nums[i] exists: where target is a paremater of the method in which we want the 2 number in nums[] to add to.
    result[1] = current index 
    result[0] = value where key is target - nums[i]

if the statements doesn't happen 
put in hashmap current index where (k,v) =(nums[i], i) 
after iterating through all the indices return array result
