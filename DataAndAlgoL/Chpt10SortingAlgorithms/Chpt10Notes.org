* Sorting Algorithms
    >> Arranges the elements of a list in a certain order (descending or ascending)
    Output is a permutation or reordering of the input
    ** Often used for database algorithms and searches

    * Classification of sorting algorithms 
        ** By number of comparisons
            Best case is O(nlogn) and worst case is O(n^2)
    
    * Internal sort:
        sort algorithms that use main memory exclusively during the sort called internal sorting. This alfgorithm assummes high speed random access to all memory

    * External Sort:
        sorting algorithms that use external memory, during the sort.
